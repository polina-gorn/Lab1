# GGR472 Lab1
 ---
 For GGR472 Lab1 we had to make a geojson and link it to a web page
 I chose to make my personal website using *HTML, JavaScript and Bootstrap*
 I did **not** use CSS other than incorporate it in the HTML code for the background colour since I was satisfied with the Bootstrap capabilities
 In the future I want to make my website more aesthetically pleasing and interactive. I want to implement floating images of reflective silver liquid shapes that will be floating in the background or at the borders of the webpage.
